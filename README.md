to run it

[LIVE DEMO](https://send-sms-hwythjlmyf.now.sh/) (should work until my free credit expires)

tested with `node@8`, `yarn@1` and on Chrome (it shouldn't work on Safari because of the missing `fetch` API)

`cp .env.editme .env` and add the relevant keys
`yarn && yarn build && yarn start`
then open `http://localhost:3000`
